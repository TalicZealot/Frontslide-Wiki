                        Any% is the most popular category for Super Metroid. As indicated above, this category involves defeating all major bosses as fast as possible without the use of out of bounds, the Golden Torizo code, or the Space Time Beam. All any% runs should start
                        by using a 0:00 file that has skipped the intro.
                        <br>
                        <br> You can create such a file by letting the intro play, then resetting once Samus has landed in Ceres Station. The PRKD (Phantoon, Ridley, Kraid, Draygon) route is faster than the KPDR (Kraid, Phantoon, Draygon, Ridley) route
                        by roughly 100 seconds in real time (and is slower by a similar amount in game time in comparison); however, it is similar in difficulty to 14%, and is not recommended to begin with. Many experienced players would not recommend
                        that you use the PRKD route until you have at least achieved a time below 50 minutes in the category with the KPDR route. You can create such a file by letting the intro play, then resetting once Samus has landed in Ceres Station.
